📱 Social Media App – Overview
This project is a full-stack Social Media Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to create accounts, post content, view others' stories and reels, follow/unfollow users, and chat in real time using Socket.io. The application also integrates Firebase for storing media files like images and videos.

🔧 Project Setup
The project is divided into two main parts:

Client – The frontend built with React.

Server – The backend built with Express and Node.js, connected to MongoDB.

Both folders (client/ and server/) are organized separately to keep the code clean and manageable.
